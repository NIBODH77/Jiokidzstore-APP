## Technical Notes
- **Web Timer Fix**: react-native-reanimated's setTimeout doesn't work reliably on web. Used polling-based timer with Date.now() for web compatibility.
- **Server Configuration**: Changed from port 8080 to port 5000 in scripts/dev-server.js for Replit webview.
- **Host Type Fix**: Expo CLI's --host flag only accepts 'lan', 'tunnel', or 'localhost'. Changed from '0.0.0.0' to 'lan'.
- **Expo CLI Fix**: Changed from npx to local node_modules/.bin/expo to avoid npx isolation issues where expo package couldn't be found.
- **Metro Bundler**: Shows "0.0% (0/1)" on fresh page loads but successfully builds full bundle (1234 modules) - this is normal cached behavior.
- **Node Version**: Upgraded to v22.17.0 (nodejs-22 module) to meet React Native 0.81.5 requirements (which need >= 20.19.4).
- **App Structure**: Uses React Navigation with splash screen → onboarding/auth flow → main tab navigator.
- **Design Theme**: Orange/peach gradient theme (#FF8C00) for JioKidz branding.

## App Flow
1. Splash Screen (3 seconds with animated logo)
2. Login/OTP Authentication flow
3. Main Tab Navigation (Home, Shopping, Explore, Parenting)
