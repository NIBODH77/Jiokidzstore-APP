You are a senior staff-level mobile product engineer and UI/UX architect
with deep experience building large-scale e-commerce apps used by millions of users.

TASK:
Analyze my existing Android-based e-commerce mobile app UI (React Native).
I have already developed a significant part of the UI.
DO NOT rewrite or discard existing components unless absolutely necessary.

Your job is to:
1. Fully understand my current UI structure, navigation, components, and flows
2. Identify gaps compared to industry-standard large-scale e-commerce apps
3. Upgrade and complete the UI into a WORLD-CLASS, PRODUCTION-READY E-COMMERCE APP

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Preserve my existing screens and logic
- Refactor only where UX, scalability, or consistency demands it
- Follow modern e-commerce design systems
- Focus ONLY on frontend UI/UX and frontend architecture (no backend logic)

## 🔹 ANALYSIS PHASE (MANDATORY)

First, analyze my current app and clearly document:

1. Existing Screens
   - Home
   - Category & Nested Category Screens
   - Product Listing (PLP)
   - Product Detail Page (PDP)
   - Cart
   - Wishlist
   - Address Management
   - Orders / Order Tracking
   - Profile / Account Screens

2. Current Strengths
   - What UI patterns are already good
   - What components are reusable
   - What navigation structure exists

3. Current Gaps
   - Missing screens
   - Missing micro-interactions
   - Incomplete flows
   - Non-scalable UI decisions

DO NOT implement yet.
ONLY ANALYZE AND WRITE FINDINGS.
