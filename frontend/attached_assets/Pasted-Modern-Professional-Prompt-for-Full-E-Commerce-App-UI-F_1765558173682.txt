Modern & Professional Prompt for Full E-Commerce App UI + Functionality Review

Task:
Review and update the complete navigation flow starting from AgeGenderLandingScreen.tsx and all its nested screens. Improve spacing, UI consistency, and validate core e-commerce functionalities.

🔧 UI & Layout Improvements

Increase top margin / top padding for all screens navigated from AgeGenderLandingScreen.tsx to maintain consistent modern spacing.

Ensure every nested page follows a unified layout structure, spacing scale, typography, and component hierarchy.

Fix any alignment, padding, or visual inconsistencies across product-list, product-detail, category, wishlist, and cart screens.

🧪 Functional Review (Core E-Commerce Features)

Thoroughly check and validate the following features:

Wishlist Functionality

Verify wishlist action works on every product card and product detail page.

Ensure wish/unwish state updates correctly in UI + local/global state.

Ensure wishlist count syncs across screens.

Add to Cart / Cart Management

Confirm products are added correctly with all required attributes (size, color, qty).

Check cart updates in real-time and survives navigation.

Validate increment/decrement quantity and remove-item actions.

Order Placement Flow

Ensure checkout process triggers correct order creation logic.

Validate payment flow integration points.

Order Tracking

Verify that order tracking updates UI according to order status values.

Check all status stages (Placed → Packed → Shipped → Out for Delivery → Delivered).

Order History

Ensure the order history page displays past orders reliably.

Validate product thumbnails, metadata, dates, prices, and status.

Confirm API/state is correctly mapped and scroll performance is smooth.

🧹 General Code Quality Review

Confirm reusable components are used consistently (buttons, cards, headers).

Clean unused code, console logs, and redundant styles.

Verify no UI breaks occur across Android/iOS screen sizes.

Ensure navigation params, types, and props are strongly typed (TypeScript best practices).
