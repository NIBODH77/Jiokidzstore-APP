✅ Requirement: Nested Page Generation

Whenever the user clicks ANY card (Girls or Boys, any age), automatically generate a full nested structure with:

1️⃣ Level 1 → Age + Gender Landing Page

Example:
“Girls | 2–4 Years”

This page must include:

Hero banner

Each category must open a dedicated category page.

This page must show:

All products

Filters (Price, Brand, Color, Size)

Sorting (Low → High, High → Low, Newest, Best Selling)

Each product must contain season tags:

Example:

Seasonal Display Logic:

When the user lands on ANY category:
